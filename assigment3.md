## Assignment 3

I wanted to see which cluster had the most crimes and, what the crime category was

To do this I

 1. Creating a Pivot table
 2. Selecting Neighborhood Cluster and moving it to columns
 3. Selecting offense and moving it to values
 4. Changing offense to be "count of offense"
 5. Selecting offense key and moving it to rows

The table resulting can be seen

As you can see, cluster 14 had the most crime, specifically property theft/other, with 133 cases.

### Crime dataset

[dc-crimes-search-results.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22649875/dc-crimes-search-results.csv)

Steps to clean data
1. Specify crime types, some have /other and it would be nice to know what "other" means
2. Separate dates and times
3. Fix typo in data category "theft f/auto"

Thus, the interesting question I chose to answer is the same as my assignment 3 question, results shown below

This is newsworthy because it can tell people who might want to move/live in DC where the most crimes take place and of what variety they are.

The answer is cluster 8 with 941 property theft/other crimes reported

Steps taken are the same:
 1. Creating a Pivot table
 2. Selecting Neighborhood Cluster and moving it to columns
 3. Selecting offense and moving it to values
 4. Changing offense to be "count of offense"
 5. Selecting offense key and moving it to rows
