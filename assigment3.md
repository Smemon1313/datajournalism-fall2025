## Assignment 3

I wanted to see which cluster had the most crimes and, what the crime category was

To do this I

 1. Creating a Pivot table
 2. Selecting Neighborhood Cluster and moving it to columns
 3. Selecting offense and moving it to values
 4. Changing offense to be "count of offense"
 5. Selecting offense key and moving it to rows

The table resulting can be seen

As you can see, cluster 14 had the most crime, specifically property theft/other, with 133 cases.

### Crime dataset

[dc-crimes-search-results.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22649875/dc-crimes-search-results.csv)

Steps to clean data
1. Specify crime types, some have /other and it would be nice to know what "other" means
2. Separate dates and times
3. Fix typo in data category "theft f/auto"

Thus, the interesting question I chose to answer is the same as my assignment 3 question, results shown below

This is newsworthy because it can tell people who might want to move/live in DC where the most crimes take place and of what variety they are.

The answer is cluster 8 with 941 property theft/other crimes reported

Steps taken are the same:
 1. Creating a Pivot table
 2. Selecting Neighborhood Cluster and moving it to columns
 3. Selecting offense and moving it to values
 4. Changing offense to be "count of offense"
 5. Selecting offense key and moving it to rows

### Story Research

Elias and I are seeing the crime rate and DC and are undecided on exactly what our question is. However, we are able to find crime data and maps for each year for the last 20+ years on dc.gov and we were able to find several articles relating to the crime rate in DC. It is important to noise that many of the articles have been published in recent weeks due to the National Guard being stationed in DC. The big thing is that everything in DC is divided by ward number which allows us to see which ward has what qualities. We will likely answer a question related to the difference in crime between wards, exact details are yet to be determined.
