## Assignment 3

I wanted to see which cluster had the most crimes and, what the crime category was

To do this I

 1. Creating a Pivot table
 2. Selecting Neighborhood Cluster and moving it to columns
 3. Selecting offense and moving it to values
 4. Changing offense to be "count of offense"
 5. Selecting offense key and moving it to rows

The table resulting can be seen
