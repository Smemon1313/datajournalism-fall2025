[One fateful decision. Years of neglect.
Five once-average schools remade into the worst in Florida.](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/5-schools-segregation/)

### My Critiques

Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

What was it? - 5, the title was very self explanatory

Was it in the headline? - 5, yes

If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent

Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization? - 0, there was not a single graph or other tool to visualize

Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? - 2, yes because simply adding graphs or other visuals would have made the piece better

Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate

List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.

3, Much of the historical explanations used phrases such as "Blacks who tried to move out of the zone were met with death threats." While this statement is not unlikely, it would be nice if it was accompanied by data or accounts of people who may have gone through these experiences.

List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.

* School Board Members
* White and Black parents in the county
* White and Black parents in other counties

Did they provide a source?

2, very few sources were provided throughout the article.

Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

5, everything was explained in detail.

Quality

Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.

3, I think the story itself is very great and discusses a very important topic. That said, it is very poorly formatted and oftentimes feels as though the writer is rambling and simply writing down all their thoughts on the page with little to no data or organization to back it up. Not once did the article even show a map of the county or schools the entire piece is focused on. Not to mention, the data given, while helpful, is extremely disorganized and just gets enveloped into the rest of the words in each paragraph.

Creativity

Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?

3

How?

The story uses several images of children in schools, school board meetings, etc. Despite this, very few of these images work to build genuine feeling and interest in the story. Mostly because most of the images are found in between segments of the article with no caption or other form of context to tell the reader what they are looking at.

### My Pitch:

I would love to see some visualization as to exactly what this county is going through. The data is there yes, but it is very hard to understand because every single number falls into jumbles of words giving it context. Thus, I propose a project where someone goes through the entire article and creates visuals that could aid the effectiveness of this article. If more data is needed, it could be found by going into some of the different school board websites or potentially reaching out to someone in the county and asking for comment. This story is very timely now in a time of uncertainty with equality in education and after reading the article thoroughly, it is very clear the importance of the data. The only other important thing is finding images from the schools as well and seeing if someone could caption the images currently in the article.
