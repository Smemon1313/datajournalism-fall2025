The original chart used pie charts which are not good for data visualization, thus I changed the pie chart to become a bar chart demonstrating precentages.
I felt a bar chart would be better to visualize, rather than several numbers all clumped in a table. Thus, I created my own horizontal bar chart.

The original chart used clocks as means of displaiyng the minutes till doomsday, which is on theme, but caused clutter.
My chart was designed to go year by year with exact data given. Because the paper was small, I labeled each point to make it clear what number it was representing.
