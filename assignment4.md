The original chart used pie charts which are not good for data visualization, thus I changed the pie chart to become a bar chart demonstrating precentages.
I felt a bar chart would be better to visualize, rather than several numbers all clumped in a table. Thus, I created my own horizontal bar chart.

The original chart was just a table of data, I wanted to add a visualization.
The reason this works is because it takes each question, applies its answer to the question, and is clearly understandable.
