# Assignment 4

For this assignment, I used Tableau

[Chart 1](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2025-week-13-work-productivity)

My Chart

The original chart used pie charts which are not good for data visualization, thus I changed the pie chart to become a bar chart demonstrating precentages.
In order to have the numbers still present, I kept them in a table above the bar chart.
This way, readers have the general idea of productivity but also can find exact numbers in the same format if they so please.
