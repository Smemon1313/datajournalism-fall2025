**The story I chose: [Extreme heat is one of the deadliest consequences of climate change](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-extreme-heat-deaths-show-climate-change-risks/)**

## Lede 

The reporter used a narrative lead in the beginning of the story when saying that “California undercounts the human toll”. This is effective in engaging the reader and communicating the overall story because it very clearly describes exactly what the story will be about while showing images that, while not directly tied to the story, help to convey the emotions of heat and the impact of heat to the reader. 

## The data 

The analysis involved two key factors: the heat in California over time, and the repercussions because of the heat. The story opens with two stories about two individuals who were drastically harmed by the California heat, then goes into how many deaths have been recorded because of heat. From there, the reporter further goes into how this is tied to global warming by displaying the difference in average temperatures since 1850. The main issue with the data presented in this article mainly lies in how much of it is wrapped in text. For example, the quote “When California’s worst heat wave in more than 50 years struck in 2006, killing an estimated 650 people and overwhelming hospitals, it should have been a wake-up call, said Paul English, who worked as an environmental epidemiologist for the state health agency for more than two decades before retiring this year” could possibly be accompanied with a graph or some other visual of the heat wave in 2006, and its impact to the people of California.  

## Sources

The story integrated human stories nicely although I feel there were points in the story in which the author could have found more sources to help emphasize what they said to experts. While at points he quotes Elizabeth Rhoades, who “directs the L.A. County health department’s climate change and sustainability program”, there are also moments where he will cite other articles but not come with quotes from sources to help. For example, the author states “Experts interviewed by The Times said an effective state response would include identifying and assisting vulnerable populations, and putting in place a surveillance system to track when and where heat-related deaths and injuries are occurring” and I think that this quote could have been accompanied by someone interviewed by the Times to make the story more cohesive. While this could have entailed the reporter interviewing the same sources interviewed for the times article, it could have also included a simple link to the times of article in question to give readers more context as to what is being referenced. That said, the sources that are present do help the story because context is very important, especially to someone who does not live in California and might not understand the severity of the heat in the southwest. 

## Story structure

The main story structure used is the martini glass style. The story begins with a very clear description of exactly what is happening and who it is happening to. Then, segways into anecdotes, followed by data of exactly what the issue is, followed by more anecdotes and concludes with a section about why they did the story. While this fits the martini glass structure, it is not the only structural element of the story. There is a clear chronological aspect of the story with many individual sections following chronological order based on whatever they are discussing. Simultaneously, all sections and aspects of the story relate back to the central idea of heat related deaths in California, showcasing elements of vignette story structure. These structures, while not explicitly defined at any given moment, all work together and make the story itself flow very nicely. 

## Numbers

Was the writing about data clear and engaging? Were there any points that felt bogged down with numbers or could have been written in an easier to understand way? Use examples. 

The numbers used in the story, while they at times can be helped by visualizations, are good descriptors of the story. Contrarily, I feel that a lot of the story opinions given need more data. For example, “Counting deaths is slow. It can take months for public health officials to verify the information in death records and longer still to finalize the data”. The quote is read as extremely subjective. What are “months” defined as? 2? 5? 10? Some data would be very useful for the reader because while the information is not unbelievable, context is severely lacking in several parts of the story. 

## Data viz 

There are only 3 data visualizations throughout the 4500+ word article. While each one is very useful in its own way, for being a data-driven article, visualizations are not used to their fullest potential. Furthermore, while the two visualizations are very good, the visualization showcasing the average temperature in California throughout the years is not very effective and is visually overwhelming. A scatterplot would have been a better choice to showcase as the reader could have seen the points progressively increase and, the author could have added a trendline to make understanding the point even easier. That said, none of the visualizations presented felt decorative or unnecessary, primarily because there is not much else for the reader to use to understand the story. 

## Methods

The author addresses one main issue with the data repeatedly, which is that California does not record several heats related deaths and that many deaths in California are not investigated to see if heat had any impact. While a nerd box is not directly used, there are several sections of the story to indicate that the data might not be perfect given deaths such as heart attacks not being recorded as heat related deaths, despite the potential heat was a contributing factor. Given this, I do not feel a specific section devoted to a nerd box was needed because the information is very understandable since it mainly relates back to a central point of “there is no telling how accurate this data is”. 

## Etc 

While I am sure this journalist was working on a deadline, it would have been great to see some more data about how heat deaths in California compared to other common causes of death in the state. Not to mention the constant repetition of how diseases and income impact the severity of heat for people, it would have been good to showcase the data for different demographics and heat related deaths. Both things could have helped the story’s overall argument. Instead, the story uses anecdotal evidence repeatedly and the story becomes a large discussion of individual’s stories which while important, give readers far less data to carry with them as they leave the article.
